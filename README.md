# Terraform Demo

Terraform code that deploys a VPC, with a private subnet, a public subnet, an EC2 instance, an Elastic Load Balancer, an autoscaling group into the private subnet and a bastion host to access the EC2 instances via SSH in a secure way.

Documentation is automatic generated by terraform-docs in markdown format.

## Requirements
